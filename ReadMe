# Weather Checker App – Streamlit

## About the App
The Weather Checker App is a Python-based web application built using Streamlit.
The application allows users to enter their name and a city name in order to retrieve real-time weather information from an external REST API.

This project demonstrates end-to-end development of a data-driven application, including API integration, data processing, interactive UI design, and cloud deployment.

The project demonstrates the full development flow:
- Data retrieval via REST API
- Python logic separation
- Interactive web UI
- Version control with GitHub
- Deployment to Streamlit Cloud
